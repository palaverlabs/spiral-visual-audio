# Spiral Visual Audio — Project Notes

## Stack
- Pure Node.js static file server (`server.js`)
- Single-file frontend (`index.html`)
- No build step, no dependencies
- Run: `node server.js` → http://localhost:3001

## TODO
- [ ] **Deploy to Vercel** — currently was hosted on Replit, no longer maintaining that. Migrate to Vercel (static export or serverless).
- [ ] **DNS migration** — point domain DNS to Vercel after deployment.
